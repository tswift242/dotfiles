Dotfiles
========

This repository contains my customized linux dotfiles. They should be cloned into the directory `~/dotfiles`. An install script is included to symlink each dotfile in this directory to the user's home directory, backing up the user's current dotfiles into the directory `~/dotfiles_old` as necessary.

Installation
------------

```bash
git clone git@github.com:tswift242/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
./dotfiles/install.sh
```
